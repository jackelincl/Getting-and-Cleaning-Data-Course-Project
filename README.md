# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Description 
In this repository you will find the following files:

### R script

A R script named run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Tidy data set

A tidy data set named tidydata.txt which is the end result after running the R script run_analysis.R over the raw data.

### CodeBook

A code book that describes the variables, the data, and provides a link to the original repository for more information
